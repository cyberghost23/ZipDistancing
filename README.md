# About:
This is Zip-Distancing API. I created this API using node.js and JavaScript.
It`s used to return the distance between a given Zip Code and a list of pre-stored Zip Codes located in the USA.
And returns the closest place with the corresponding Zip Code using HTTP GET Request.
Using a mathematical ecuation to calculate distances, given longitude and latitude of each zip code.

you can find the equation below in the (calculate) function.

I created this as a task for a small business.



Hope you like it!
